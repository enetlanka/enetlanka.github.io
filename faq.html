          <div align="justify"><br />
          </div>
          <div align="justify">An exact figure cannot be given as the response can depend on many factors such as </div>
          <div align="justify"><br />
          </div>
          <ul>
            <li>How attractive is your email subject line. Does it attract people’s attention to click and open the email? </li>

            <li>Is your offer appealing to the majority of the people in the data base or, is it appealing only to one segment in the base, such as female only, high income earners only. </li>
            <li>Are you sending this advertisement at the right time – for example, sending a advertisement for a higher educational coursers soon after A/L will be a big hit. </li>
            <li>How attractive and creative is your advertisement? In other words, “have you followed the artwork design guidelines explained at “templates” page?”</li>
          </ul>

          </div>
          <div align="justify"><strong>2.    How do the Results of the Email Campaigns get Monitored?</strong></div>
          <div align="justify"><br />
          </div>
          <div align="justify">One email transmission may take about 2 – 3 weeks to complete. </div>
          <div align="justify"><br />
          </div>
          <div align="justify">After the transmission is completed, our system will tell us how many mails actually got delivered and bounced. We can compile this information in to a report. You can request a report, and we can send this to you for your information and records. </div>
          <div align="justify"><br />
          </div>
          <div align="justify">However, this report will not tell you, how many people actually opened the email and clicked on the advertisement. </div>
          <div align="justify"><br />
          </div>
          <div align="justify">We doing modification to give you the correct details for the “Open Rate” and “Click Through Rate, CTR” data in the future for all our campaigns, but still we have some difficulties on that due to the high restriction that created by mail servers and spam filters. </div>
          <div align="justify"><br />
          </div>
          <div align="justify"><strong>3.    How to Pay for The Services?</strong></div>
          <div align="justify"><br />
          </div>
          <div align="justify">You can deposit cash or cheque into our bank account. When you are ready to advertise with us we will send you our bank details.</div>
          <div align="justify"><br />

          <div align="justify"></div>
          <div align="justify"><br />
          </div>
          <div align="justify"><strong>4.    How Was Our E-mail Database Created?</strong></div>
          <div align="justify"><strong><br />
          </strong></div>
          <div align="justify">It is good for you to be aware that E NET LANKA has the largest E-mail Database which only contains E-mail addresses of Sri Lankan individuals. Our Email Database contains E-mail Addresses of over 300,000 E-mail Addresses and we are proud to inform you that it rapidly keeps growing every day. Surprisingly you have hit the right spot to carry out your E-mail campaign. A big question that a lot of clients bring up is, &quot;How did you’ll get all these Email Addresses?&quot;</div>
          <div align="justify"><br />
          </div>
          <div align="justify">We carried out a survey and have done major research on Internet Users and what E-mail Services that they mainly use. We have identified that Google, Yahoo, Hotmail, Sri Lanka Telecom, are a few main E-mail service providers that Sri Lankan Internet Users would always try. We also have gathered information and email addresses from the local News paper advertisements and magazines and added them to our Database. We also have collected E-mail addresses from E-mail forwarding and Visiting Cards, Brochures, Hand Bills and known sources. The main source is our Online Subscription Form in our Official Web Site www.enetlanka.com. We have a lot of users who gets subscribed to our E-mail List every day. The other question that a client might want to know is &quot;How do we assure that all these E-mail addresses are from Sri Lanka?&quot;</div>
          <div align="justify"><br />
          </div>
          <div align="justify">For Yahoo, Google and Hotmail or any other International E-mail Service Providers, we search the users by countries and religions. This easily enables us to identify the Sri Lankan users. If it is not from a known E-mail Service Provider, once a week we carry out a process called a &quot;Cleanup Test&quot;. A Cleanup Test is where we check all the E-mail Addresses and their Internet Protocol addresses and check if those E-mail addresses are in the range of Sri Lankan Internet Protocol Addresses. If they are not in the range of Sri Lankan Internet Protocol Addresses, we remove them from our E-mail Database and add them to our Online Groups (Yahoo, Google) which we have created for our International Users.</div>
          <div align="justify"><br />
          </div>
          <div align="justify">This way we assure our clients that all the contacts in our Database are Active Internet Users in Sri Lanka.</div>
          <div align="justify"><br />
          </div>
          <div align="justify"><br />

          <div align="justify"><strong>5.    How does E-mail Advertising Help You?</strong></div>
